/**********************************************************************

  TimeSimulation class simulates signal of current in time
  generated in the strips by particles hits.

  The signal simulated, line from 0 to peak and an exponential
  descent, based on collected charge.

  Charge collecting process follows the capacitor charging law and
  noise is added to charge signal.
